# https://www.imt-ip.pt/ - não cumpre WCAG 2.0 AA

#TODO: find a good tool to make the validation on request
# https://achecker.ca/documentation/web_service_api.php - API usage depends on user account creation
# webaim.org - API's not gratis

# While we don't have a validator on request, let's find out if a known violation still exists
## 20/05/2018: - several images without an alt attribute:
## 28/02/2019: the missing alts case is no longer a problem, but to comply with WCAG the XHTML also needs to be valid...
##             https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iefp.pt%2F
##             tidy is a great validator, but isn't catching the errors on this
##             page as errors, even if it shows them as warnings... let's be hacky and pay
##             attention only on the current use case:
## 03/04/2019: XHTML is now valid, but there are empty headers now, in violation of levels A and AA
